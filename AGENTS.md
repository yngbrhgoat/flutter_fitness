## Coding
Everything is in flutter / sql
Always specify a return type if possible
format the code for a good readability
always run tests after every change to validate your code
never delte a test unless the code replated to it was deleted

also consider for testing the app that it is possible to run the app locally (without a server)

## Design
Use a clean, modern design (light, bright), use round boundaries etc...
